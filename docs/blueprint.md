## Core Features:

- User Authentication: Secure user login and signup functionality.
- Note Creation & Editing: Create, edit, and save notes with a title and content, similar to Google Keep.
- Tagging System: Add multiple tags to each note for categorization (e.g., 'Hindi', 'Tamil', 'Devotional').
- Metadata Enrichment Tool: Allow users to add album and artist information to each note; LLM analyzes notes content and user input for context. This is a tool.
- Search Functionality: Search notes by title, content, album, or artist information.
- Tag-Based Filtering: Filter notes by selecting multiple tags from a collapsible left pane. Resulting notes must have all selected tags.
- Infinite Scroll: Display notes in an infinitely scrollable list on the home page.
- Chord Highlighting: Highlight chords within notes (e.g., '(F)', '[C]') with an accent color.
- Note Editing: Enable editing of existing notes, pre-filling the edit UI with the note's data.
- Chord Transposition: Allow temporary transposition of chords up or down while viewing a note.
- Tag Display and Addition: Display all tags attached to the current note, with an option to add more tags via a popup with a searchable list.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Warm orange (#FFB347) to highlight the call to action and other key functions.
- Background color: Light grey (#F5F5F5), nearly white, to allow notes to be visually prominent.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#D0BFFF) for a calming and creative atmosphere.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for a personal, expressive feel. Body font: 'Alegreya' (serif) for readability of longer text.
- Responsive layout with a collapsible left pane for tag filtering and a floating action button for adding new notes. Mimic Google Keep's layout for note display.
- Smooth transitions and animations when opening, closing, and editing notes.
- Use clean, modern icons for tags and actions. Icons should complement the overall minimalist aesthetic.
